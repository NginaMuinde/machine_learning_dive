## TOPIC: Customer Churn Prediction and Retention Strategies for Vodafone Corporation

#### Project Understanding and Description:
In order for Telco companies to grow their revenue generating base, it is important for them to attract new customers and at the same time avoid contract terminations (known as churn). In the real world different reasons cause customers to terminate their contracts, for example; better price offers and more interesting packages from competitors, bad service experiences with current provider or change of customersâ€™ personal preferences and situations.

#### Project Objective:
The main objective in this project based on the data provided, is to leverage machine learning models to predict customer churn within Vodafone Corporation, a leading telecommunication company. Customer churn or the loss of customers over time, is a critical concern and understanding the factors influencing churn can inform proactive retention strategies for our client.

Our task is to train machine learning models to predict churn on an individual customer basis and take counter measures such as discounts, special offers or other gratifications to keep their customers. A customer churn analysis is a typical classification problem within the domain of supervised learning.

In this project, a basic machine learning pipeline based on a sample data set from Kaggle is build and performance of different model types is compared. The pipeline used for this example consists of 8 steps:

Step 1: Problem Definition

Why do customers churn? We need to establish the reasons why customers churn and train a machine model to be able to predict whether a customer will churn.

Step 2: Data Collection
We have three sources of data.
The first and second data are for machine training the third data is for machine testing.

First I started by importing the relevant libraries and modules

#### Summary:

1. **Before SMOTE:**
   - Random Forest consistently performed the best with the highest accuracy (78.99%) and F1 score (78.21%).
   - Logistic Regression and Decision Tree also showed competitive performance.

2. **After SMOTE:**
   - Random Forest maintained its strong performance with an accuracy of 77.99% and an improved F1 score of 78.12%.
   - Logistic Regression and Decision Tree also exhibited slight improvements.
   - K Nearest Neighbors and Gaussian Naive Bayes, although improved, still lag behind in performance.

3. **Overall:**
   - Random Forest remains the top-performing model after applying SMOTE, demonstrating robustness to class imbalance.
